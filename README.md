# Python Passive Recon Toolkit

*A growing collection of Python‑based OSINT & passive reconnaissance tools.*

---

## Overview

This repository is my personal project where I’m building a series of **passive reconnaissance tools using Python**.
Each tool focuses on a specific OSINT technique used during the recon phase of ethical hacking.

The goal is to strengthen my fundamentals in cybersecurity while practicing clean scripting, automation, and recon workflows.

> ⚠️ **Ethics First**
> These tools are for **educational use and authorized testing only**.
> Never scan domains, systems, or assets without explicit permission.

## Purpose of This Repo

This series helps me learn:

* OSINT collection methods
* Python automation for security
* Recon workflows used in real pentesting
* Threat footprinting
* How attackers build a recon profile
* How defenders can reduce exposed data
